										<h2 class="major">Our Project</h2>
										<p>My interest in IT began at around the age of 12. This began with the first computer my family had at home. Although I used it often, the real interest was sparked by when a problem would happen with the computer. Much like puzzle solving, I would search my way through different areas of the operating system, trying to figure out what the problem was. This helped me figure out the basics, such as what an operating system was, memory, hard drive space and so on. As I got older this developed into an interest in the hardware side of IT and when I had the money available, I would either tinker with broken PCâ€™s, or build brand new ones, one of which this very work is being created on.
I chose to come to RMIT because of the very practical based approach. Although I do have much respect for theory and textbooks from which to learn, I generally have become far more proficient in things I learn by combining theories and knowledge with real hands-on practice. I believe it is an efficient way to learn, but also serves as good preparation for a real-world environment.
My expectations as far as what I expect to learn would be a far more in-depth knowledge of IT, in addition to learning more specific or specialised areas, such as programming. Throughout my studies I expect that where I want to ultimately end up in the IT field could possibly change, which I am open to.
