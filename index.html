										<h2 class="major">My IT Interest</h2>
										<p>My interest in IT began at around the age of 12. This began with the first computer my family had at home. Although I used it often, the real interest was sparked by when a problem would happen with the computer. Much like puzzle solving, I would search my way through different areas of the operating system, trying to figure out what the problem was. This helped me figure out the basics, such as what an operating system was, memory, hard drive space and so on. As I got older this developed into an interest in the hardware side of IT and when I had the money available, I would either tinker with broken PC’s, or build brand new ones, one of which this very work is being created on.
I chose to come to RMIT because of the very practical based approach. Although I do have much respect for theory and textbooks from which to learn, I generally have become far more proficient in things I learn by combining theories and knowledge with real hands-on practice. I believe it is an efficient way to learn, but also serves as good preparation for a real-world environment.
My expectations as far as what I expect to learn would be a far more in-depth knowledge of IT, in addition to learning more specific or specialised areas, such as programming. Throughout my studies I expect that where I want to ultimately end up in the IT field could possibly change, which I am open to.

										<h2 class="major">IT Project Idea</h2>
										<p>My IT project idea is in the health sector. As a primary carer for my mother who is both a heart attack and stroke victim, as well as being diabetic, this idea was inspired by her medication needs. The idea can be implemented as possibly an app, or a chatbot. It would essentially work as a digital Webster pack, with the idea of reminders and schedules. With the chatbot, each time a medication has been taken, it can be logged or ticked off. In addition to this, the chatbot would be set up in such a way that if a medication for the day and time has not been logged, it can send a message to the user to remind them they have missed their medication.
Often, I would notice my mother skip her medication either by forgetting, or even after it had been taken, she would forget if she had taken it. Although physical Webster packs already exist, they need to be prepared each week. This chatbot can have a set schedule, with only needing to be prepared for each individual one time. It could also serve another purpose that it would contain a log to help the user fill physical Webster packs each week. As stroke is the third leading cause of death in Australia, there is the possibility of widespread use across the country, as many stroke victims are disabled after the event.
This product could be designed as a chatbot, but also possibly as a app as well. Initially, once a user has been seen by a Doctor and prescribed medication, the user will input the data into the chatbot or app. This data would include the exact name of the medication, what days it should be taken and at what time, the correct dosage, and whether it should be taken with food or not. In addition to this, the user could input and record any other relevant information such as having a bad reaction to medication, unusual side effects, whether it has been effective or not, as well as any allergies. A warning could be implemented if any future prescriptions could cause allergic reactions that may have been overlooked during medical consultation. As the goal of a Webster-pak is to aide in adherence to medication (WebsterCare 2020), the use of a chatbot or app in this sense could further support that goal. While Webster-pak’s alone do help with this, the ability to receive reminders, record data and use it for medical recording via a device such as a phone or tablet could help a lot as these devices have become so widespread and are used by many people multiple times throughout the day. This repeated exposure to digital devices could very well increase the likelihood that users are reminded to take their medication, what dosage, and at what time.
For development, a Chatbot can be created using a coded and non-coded solution. The non-coded solution such as Chatfuel can be an easier approach, but it also has limitations. (Goyal, A 2020). The coded solution can be customised far more. There is Microsoft Bot Framework, wit.ai by Facebook, and Google’s Dialogflow. Devices for testing would also be needed. On the user end, it would be designed primarily for devices such as smart phones and tablets, as these are more widespread and readily accessible for users. Use on PC would be possible, but smart devices offer more accessibility, especially for the disabled as their movements may be limited.
The skills required for this should not be too high of a requirement, but still not an easy task for an early programmer. It requires that I become proficient in the development software previously stated, specifically the code-based solutions. Although a non-code-based solution is possible, it is likely that it may not meet the requirements for my goal. Hardware should be relatively easy as the programming can be written on a PC, then tested on a device or possibly a virtual environment. The real difficulty as previously stated, lies in learning the programming language for the chosen development software.
If this project is successful, the projected outcome is that users will have a higher level of adherence to their required medications. As many who suffer from a stroke, heart attack or other conditions could see these conditions become worse if the correct medications are not taken regularly, the use of this chatbot could help reduce future risks to the user, attributing to overall better health and possibly even a higher quality of life. The one who benefits most from this outcome is the user ultimately.

									<h2 class="major">Ideal Job and Personal Profile</h2>
									<p>Below are some examples of tests that illustrate my learning style, creativity, personality type and ideal job in future.</p>
									<section class="features">
										<article>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Software Developer Job</h3>
											<p>Ideally, I would like to move towards software development and programming such as the following https://rb.gy/n1ldc2 . This job is specifically within the cyber security field. This role includes software development, data analysis and management, and automation specifically within a governmental environment. I find this role appealing as it does deal with software development and programming, as well as being a relatively secure job as it is within the government sector. That being said, I would be willing to work both in private or government sectors, especially early in my career in order to gain experience.
Primarily, this role requires one to be proficient in the use of Python and Django programming languages. Other responsibilities include the reviewing of code, liaising with other employees or clients, and contributing to the technical design solutions for any given project.
This roles largest requirement is the proficient use of Python and Django programming languages, in addition to 5+ years of software development experience. The job also requires that one configuration, implementing and the support in using both COTS (commercial off the shelf) and bespoke platforms.
As my current experience would not qualify me for this role, I am looking at this or similar roles from a long-term plan perspective. Although I am experienced with the use of software, and have a little knowledge in programming languages, it is currently too limited to qualify me for this role. My experience thus-far in programming is some HTML many years back when studying graphic design, some experience with Action Script, and a small amount of Java so far in my current studies.
My first goal in working towards this role would be to become proficient in Python and Django. This would serve in other areas also, as these programming languages are quite common, so it would assist in opening doorways to use these languages in a professional experience, thus also gaining the 5+ years of programming experience in the process. As I am currently studying, I have the time now to learn these languages over the duration of my study. I will also need to get my foot in the door when finishing my studies to gain the experience in the IT field. As this would be early in my career, I would be very open to any role within the field and possibly also grant opportunities within the field to work towards more specific areas. In essence, my qualification will come once I have completed my degree, which will also give me skills as well as studying these various languages in my own time. The experience I hope to get from first getting my foot in the door or through a experience placement position possibly.

											<h3 class="major">Personality Type</h3>
											<p>This is a personality type test taken from www.16personalities.com. The INFP type suggests that of a mediator and one that values individualism, creativity and expression, the exploration of new ideas and values and often encourage others to experiment with a similar path. Taking this into account, this could indicate that a role that explores new ideas with the opportunity to be creative and experiment could be well suited to me. This could possibly be in the form of marketing in IT, which could suit me well as I have some experience in graphic design and the common software that it uses.
 In terms of a team environment, I would possibly have to go against the grain of this personality type as it does seem to indicate that individuals such as these often will work alone. Although there could be instances where individualism is valued, team projects are likely more common, so I would need to be sure that I am working as a valued team member.
When creating a team of individuals, I would assess my own strengths and weaknesses and try to find people that help to counter-act any weaknesses. For example, if my strengths lie in creativity or exploration, I may favour a team member that has skills that are more technical or logic based.

											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">My Learning Style</h3>
											<p>The results of this test show that I am a visual/tactile learner. This indicates that I tend to learn things effectively through visual means by remembering them by sight. This can be in the form of colour coding things, sketches or diagrams, visual references, and writing down key words. The tactile aspect quite simply suggests that I can learn effectively through real, hands-on practice. Particularly interesting is that it is suggested that tactile learners can learn effectively using a computer, as it offers physical touch and results.
These results for me have proven effective before. As an illustrator, I have refined my skills through watching other artists, using visual references, and then practicing them on my own. I do believe I could apply this same method to the IT field.
This has also reinforced my belief in the way I have learned in previous years. Within a team environment, I could learn skills from other members by observing their practices and then trying them on my own. This will be particularly useful for skills that I have not quite developed yet. It could be done in a physical setting, for example: watching another member typing a particular programming language and keeping a visual reference of it.
Regarding the formation of team members, it could be beneficial to have other members that are of a different learning style. As the visual/tactile learning style is often associated with creative people, it would further reinforce my position that other team members could be more technical minded, word oriented or so on.
</p>

											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Creativity Test</h3>
											<p>I took this creativity test as a measure against what my current perceptions of my strengths are. With my background in design and illustration, I wanted to see how I would be rated. The result of 62/80 would seem about right to me. However, it is the missing 18 points that I find interesting. Although speculating, it could indicate that I have strengths in other areas but are yet to be fully developed.
The influence this result would have over my behaviour in a team environment is that it would encourage me to use my strengths, such as creativity and design experience, but also use the opportunity to push myself into other areas. I would ultimately like to be able to combine my creative skills with more technical skills so increase my viability as an employee in the future.
I cannot say that the results of this test would have much influence on forming a team, as it mostly reinforced what I already knew, while revealing the possibility of other strengths. It could influence me in the sense that if I can identify these other areas that are weaker, then I would choose team members that are more adept in those areas so I can both learn from them and produce a good final project in the process.
